            <h2>Hi, I'm Neal</h2>
            <p>
                I am a Computer Science student at Georgia Institute of Technology passionate about the intersection of robotics and AI. Growing up I always watched Battle Bots with my dad ever Friday, and now I get to tinker with the machines I've grown to love! I first got to tinker with robots through VEX robotics at my high school, tinker now through building sumo and combat robots, and hopefully get to tinker with them for a job in the future! 
            <p>
               While I do love robotics, I also have many other hobbies! I love watching anything from thought provoking movies to parodies on YouTube. I also love playing video games and imersing myself into their communities and histories. If I'm doing anything else, it's hanging out with friends and family, and probably plotting my next project.
            </p>
